"This project implements a text-to-speech (TTS) system using machine learning techniques. It leverages deep learning algorithms to convert written text into natural-sounding speech. The repository contains code for training neural networks on text and audio datasets to generate high-quality speech output. Our goal is to build an efficient and versatile TTS model that can be easily integrated into various applications."
